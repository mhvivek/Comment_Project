I would hope that our class is a comfortable space for all of us to talk. She has been on top of schoolwork and has completed all the homework assignments this year. Grace solves problem sets with ease (94.4 average), but finds tests more difficult (87.4 average). If Grace isn't already, I would suggest preparing for tests by writing down the answers to review packets by hand. That way, she can simulate a test situation and itentify which areas are most challenging for her. \n",
